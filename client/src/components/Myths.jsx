    myth: 'Myth 7: You need to have a specific blood type to donate blood.',

  {
    myth: 'Myth 10: Donating blood is time-consuming.',
    fact: 'Fact: The process of donating blood usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour, including the pre-donation screening and post-donation recovery period. However, the actual blood collection typically lasts around 10 minutes. Some blood collection centers also offer expedited processes for regular donors to save time.',
